# Get A Tech Job
### A collection of actually helpful resources for your journey into to world of professional software development

The purpose of this repo is to be a central location for new, aspiring and even experienced developers to find actually useful and practical information on how to become an attractive, job-ready programmer who can be confident in their abilities and won't fall appart the minute they actually get a job.

This repo will consist exlusively of .md files whick will be used to then build the wiki for your viewing pleasure. The .md files will be split into the following groups:

- Self-presentation (resume, Linkedin, networking, etc.)
- Conceptual (OAuth 2.0, "What is REST?", HTTP 1.1, etc.)
- Language-specific (Java, Node.JS, Python, etc.)

I have created this repo after having gotten fed up with all the horribly weak online resources whick make up much of what is available, most of which are really just "get rich quick" scams that make you feel like you're learning everything when you are in fact barely scratching the surface. 

**This is not a place to advertise your own _"become a developer and make $100k a month in under 30 days!"_ scam.** I will  be strictly currating all of the content proposed along with whatever other devs I know and trust for the purpose of getting yoou the best adn most relevant information on the web. That said, not everything will be free, but most of it will be free and the rest will be worth your money. **If it's on Udemy and it's $9.99 _"for a limited time only"_, it  will be that same price at the end of next month, too.** This is not for my/our financial benefit, it's for the sake of the community.
